Doorman
=======

Doorman it's a super simple (aka stupid) white/black list manager.

Doorman acts  different depending on the kind of list you're asking:
        If you ask if somenthing could pass based on the whitelist it would let throught only entities present on the whitelist.
        If you ask if somenthing could pass based on the blacklist it would let throught everything except for entities present on the blacklist.

You'll define those list on a yaml file like this:

white: [vicentin@email.com, .*@simplelogica.net]

black: [loki@email.com, .*@comunistasnazis.net] 
         
It allows ruby regular expresions as shown.

Configuration
=============

For Rails projects:
    
    config.gem 'doorman'

    Doorman::CONFIG_FILE_PATH = "path-to-your-yml"

Example
=======

Doorman::Whitelist.come_in?('vicentin@email.com') # => true
Doorman::Whitelist.come_in?('diego@simplelogica.net') # => true
Doorman::Whitelist.come_in?('someone@email.com') # => false

Doorman::Blacklist.come_in?('vicentin@email.com') # => true
Doorman::Blacklist.come_in?('diego@simplelogica.net') # => true
Doorman::Blacklist.come_in?('loki@email.com') # => false
Doorman::Blacklist.come_in?('rouco@comunistasnazis.net') # => false  

I think you've got the idea.
